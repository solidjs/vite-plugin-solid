'vite-plugin-solid': patch
---

The native `@dom-expressions/compiler` is now the default JSX compiler (`compiler: 'native'`). `compiler: 'babel'` remains available as an escape hatch that switches ONLY the JSX transform back to `babel-preset-solid` — if native output differs from your expectations, set it and file an issue (the behavioral diff between the modes is the bug report). Babel is also still required where native Node addons are unavailable (e.g. StackBlitz WebContainers).

The `lazy()` module-URL pass and the solid-refresh HMR pass now run through native compiler passes (`transformLazy` / `transformRefresh`) in every mode, ahead of whichever JSX backend is selected, with sourcemaps chained across all passes. The plugin's own `lazy-module-url` Babel plugin is deleted (the placeholder format and its bundler-side resolution are unchanged), and supplying custom `babel` options in native mode reintroduces a Babel support pass hosting just those options.

HMR wrappers in all modes now import the refresh runtime from the dev-only `solid-js/refresh` core entry, and the `solid-refresh` package dependency is removed entirely — this also fixes solid-refresh#85 (stale registrations resurrected after full-tree disposal on Solid 2.0) for what was previously the Babel path. Requires the solid-js release that ships the `solid-js/refresh` entry (landing with this release train).
