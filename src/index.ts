/**
 * Chunks emitted for lazy() targets are marked `isEntry` by Rollup even

 * detection (which keys off `isEntry`) can't pick a lazy facade instead of
 * the real client entry. Works on both the Vite manifest.json shape and the
 * raw Rollup output bundle — both key entries by name and expose
 * `dynamicImports` / `isEntry` with the same meaning.
 *
 * Being a dynamic-import target alone does not make a chunk a lazy facade,
 * though: the real client entry becomes one whenever it absorbs a module
 * that is also dynamically imported somewhere else. Solid 2 produces that
 * shape on its own — `@solidjs/web/frames/client` lazily imports the
 * serialization decoder (`loadCodec()`), so a static import of
 * `@solidjs/web/serialization/decode` anywhere in the client graph merges
 * the decoder into the entry chunk, and the entry then lists itself (or is
 * listed by another lazy chunk) under `dynamicImports`. Stripping `isEntry`
 * there leaves the bundle with no entry at all ("No entry file found"
 * downstream, e.g. TanStack Start's manifest capture, #342). Genuine
 * configured entries are therefore never reclassified, and a chunk's
 * dynamic import of itself is not an edge worth acting on.
 *
 * Rolldown caveat: of the flags written here only `isEntry` is synced back
 * to the native bundle after the hook (rolldown's `update_output_chunk`
 * copies `code`, `map`, `imports`, `dynamicImports`, `isEntry` and the file
 * name; `isDynamicEntry` is kept from the original chunk). Later plugins
 * and Vite's manifest plugin therefore see reclassified facades as neither
 * entry nor dynamic entry under rolldown. The manifest `load` path repairs
 * `isDynamicEntry` on the plugin's own manifest module, the one place it
 * controls end to end.

  // environment must build first. Start mode's own orchestration already
  // orders it that way (environment definition order), but a composed setup
  // whose orchestrator builds server environments first (e.g.
  // @cloudflare/vite-plugin's buildApp, which builds workers before client)
  // would bake a manifest-less fallback into the server bundle. Every user
  // of such a setup had to hand-write this ordering plugin; absorb it.
  //
  // Semantics:
  // - The first hook builds the client environment first, but only where
  //   the ordering matters: a client build that emits a manifest and
  //   actually has an input. It runs at *normal* order, deliberately not
  //   `pre`: pre-order buildApp hooks are where hosts do destructive
  //   preparation — nitro v3's `nitro:prepare` rm -rf's the whole output
  //   directory from a pre-order hook, so a pre-order client build sorted
  //   before it built into a directory that was then wiped (client assets
  //   and manifest gone, the manifest-less fallback baked into the server
  //   bundle, prod 500s). Normal order still runs before every known
  //   server-first orchestrator: a config-level `builder.buildApp`
  //   (@cloudflare/vite-plugin's workers-before-client orchestrator) is
  //   invoked by Vite only after all pre- and normal-order plugin hooks
  //   (just before the first post-order hook), and hook-based orchestrators
  //   (nitro's `nitro:main`, cloudflare's own companion hook) declare
  //   post order. Orchestrators running after skip the client via `isBuilt`
  //   (or at worst rebuild it, which is wasteful but correct — the manifest
  //   exists either way when the server environments build).
  // - Building anything from a hook suppresses Vite's own
  //   build-all-environments fallback (it only runs when *no* environment
  //   is built), so a setup with no real orchestrator — e.g. start mode's
  //   plain `builder: {}` — would end up with only the client built. The
  //   post-order hook reinstates exactly that fallback: when nothing but
  //   our own client build has happened and no other plugin stakes a claim
  //   on the app build, build the remaining environments in definition
  //   order, precisely what Vite would have done. Another plugin declaring
  //   a non-pre `buildApp` hook counts as such a claim even when it hasn't
  //   built anything yet (its post-order hook may sort after ours):
  //   building on its behalf would break staged orchestration (nitro
  //   prerenders and copies public assets before its final server bundle)
  //   and can error outright on environments the orchestrator knows to
  //   skip (e.g. ones with no rollup input). Pre-order hooks don't count —
  //   by convention they prepare (clean output dirs) rather than build.
