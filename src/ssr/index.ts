// Start-mode serving for plain Vite apps: `solid({ start: {...} })` (or the
// zero-config sugar `start: true`) adds a serving layer with conventional
// entries so no hand-rolled wiring is needed, and the plugin's `ssr`
// boolean picks the mode — `ssr: true` server-renders the app per request;
// `ssr: false`/omitted is client mode (the same conventions, but the
// document shell is served/prerendered empty and the app `render()`s
// client-side). The flip between them is that one boolean.
//
// SSR mode (`start` + `ssr: true`):
// - Dev: runnable SSR environments are served by a Vite middleware. Provider-
//   owned environments serve through `virtual:solid-ssr-handler` instead.
//   Both paths inject the Vite client, dev style patch, and entry CSS as
//   `<style data-vite-dev-id>` tags before the body can paint.
// - Prod: the plugin configures a full-app build (client + server bundles
//   via the Vite environments/builder API — a single `vite build` builds
//   both) whose server entry is `virtual:solid-ssr-handler`: an
//   adapter-agnostic named `handleRequest(Request) => Promise<Response>` plus
//   a default Fetchable `{ fetch(request) }` export. Both scope each request
//   with `provideRequestEvent`, stream the render, and resolve hashed client
//   assets through `virtual:solid-manifest`.
// - Entries are conventional with escape hatches: `src/entry-server.*` /
//   `src/entry-client.*` are used when present (or set explicitly); when
//   absent, default entries are generated from a single root component
//   (`start.app`, defaulting to `src/App.*`) wrapped in a document shell
//   (`start.document`, defaulting to `src/Document.*`, else a built-in one).
// - When `serverFunctions` is also enabled, the handler composes the
//   endpoint on every surface; the runnable-dev server-function middleware
//   pre-loads the referenced module, then dispatches through this handler.
// - Every dispatch runs under a stub-backed request event
//   (`createRequestEvent`) with the optional `start.middleware` chain fronting
//   it, and page responses go through the runtime's `createSSRResponse`
//   head lifecycle (commit at shell flush, real pre-flush redirects, the
//   script fallback post-flush).
// - `start.renderMode` decides how a page render becomes a body: `'stream'`
//   (default) flushes the shell with fallbacks and streams boundaries in
//   behind it; `'async'` awaits the settled document (no fallbacks or swap
//   scripts — complete for no-JS clients); a module path decides per
//   request, and `handleRequest(request, { renderMode })` overrides both.
// - `vite preview` serves dist/client statically and dispatches everything
//   else through the built handler — the production path, middleware
//   included, with no server file needed.
//
// Client mode (`start` without `ssr: true`) rides the same machinery with
// three deltas: the generated server entry renders the document shell
// WITHOUT the app (dev serving doubles as history fallback, and a
// post-build hook prerenders it once into dist/client/index.html), the
// generated client entry render()s instead of hydrating, and dist/server is
// dropped from the output unless `serverFunctions` needs it for the
// endpoint. Client code compiles non-hydratable, exactly like a plain SPA.
